# The-Snake-Game-Project
This is a project I completed as an assignment in my Python Udemy Course by Angela Yu, it's not easy to pick up OOP at first but I'm still trying to have better grasp of it. Anyway, the game might have some bugs and I hope that you could give me some feedbacks if possible, thanks for dropping by my Github.
