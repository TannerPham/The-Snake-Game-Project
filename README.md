# The-Snake-Game-Project
This is a project I completed as an assignment in my Python Udemy Course by Angela Yu, it's not easy to pick up OOP at first but I'm still trying to have better grasp of it. Anyway, the game might have some bugs and I hope that you could give me some feedbacks if possible, thanks for dropping by my Github.

Quick notes:
1. There are 4 modules in this project, each contains it owns properties and methods that help the main file get up and runing
2. The size of the screen is set up in the main file, you can modify it if you want
3. You can change the size of the while square border of the game in border class located in the border file but remember to change positions of the "invisible" walls in the main file as well
4. The probability of occurring bonus point is pretty high, you can increase the range in the random function in the mainfile if you want to reduce the occurence likelihood of the bonus point.

There will be updates in case I think of new features for the game.
